# Portfolio Online 

This is my online profile, portfolio, and cv. It is a great way to showcase my skills and portfolio for prospective employers not only for my web development skills but also my design portfolio. 
This is an update to the previous portfolio project which was meant to test our skills with using CSS frameworks; this is a showcase of the skills I have learnt over the last 8 weeks of the Full stacked Coding bootcamp run by the University of Birmingham. 
The Problem this solves for me is having my portfolio all in one place in an easily spendable format as visual content is often too large for emails to send everything you wish to. It is also a great way for people to find you and see what you are capable with contact options should they believe you would be a good fit for their requirements. 

I have been able to cement fundamental theories in HTML and CSS. One final showcase in the front end before diving into the back end of web coding. 
Hopefully, my portfolio stands out not just because of my coding skills but because I have the ability to design as well. I have training in design, graphics and layout and the tools to help me basically create anything I want to display. 
Aside from design, I have had a lot of fun with the media queries and Bootstrapâ€™s responsive settings making the layout restack and reorder as the screen shrinks. Hopefully, this will stand out as a great responsive portfolio.

## Improvements

### From Previous 02_Portfolio

Improvements that i would like to highlight from my last porfolio are: 

1. The use of popovers rather than tooltips to better present text and additional information with the skills badges.

![Revit popover](assets/images/screenshots/revit-popover.png)

2. Better placement of the design skills section

3. The text is better presented in the skills aside bar due to the popovers here.

### Future Improvements

the popovers show over each other and have to be clicked again to remove. There could be a way (probably javascript) to remove the first when another is clicked. 

## Updates

(28.01.2021) 
- Popovers are now dissabled when focus is no longer on the item. 
- University badges stack better for mobile response. 
- Github profile link added to contacts 
- Computer skills stack better for mobile response. 
- Projects updated with Major Project 2 and best selection of deployed weekly projects.
